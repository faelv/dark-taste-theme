# Good Taste Theme

I don't like dark themes, can't stare at then for too long, so while searching for a good light theme the only
one I found was the [Netbeans Light Theme by Ondrej Brejla](https://github.com/obrejla/vscode-netbeans-light-theme) which
misses support for PHP, so I took it and used it as a base for this one with a few UI tweaks and support for PHP and SQL.

Supported languages:
- PHP
- SQL
- JavaScript (JSON)
- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Java
- _May work great with others too, like Go..._
