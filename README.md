A dark theme focusing on low contrast ratio and warm, dark gray backgrounds.
Better suitable for dark environments.

> **Note on Semantic Highlight:** This theme aims to provide color highlighting for specific language features instead of a
generic support for all of them. Currently, it's not possible to achieve the same thing with semantic highlight, so it
was disabled for this theme. If semantic highlight becomes mandatory in the future, I won't be able to maintain this
extension anymore.

I hope you like it. Feedback is welcome!

Usually no one bothers to do it, but if you liked this extension consider leaving a rating and/or review, it means a lot to me.
